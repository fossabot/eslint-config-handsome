# eslint-config-handsome

ðŸ¤˜Handsome ESLint [shareable config][eslint-shareable-config]. Enforces strict and readable code.ðŸ¤˜

## Rules

This config aims to improve code readability which is good for team collaboration. So it's a little bit strict but not too much.  
The details are more cumbersome, not one by one description here. You could find detailed rules in the code.

Here are some basic rules about stylistic:

- __Tab indentation__ - You can control width personalized ["Why tabs are superior"](http://lea.verou.me/2012/01/why-tabs-are-clearly-superior/).
- __One true brace style with single line allowed__
- __Single-quotes__ - Except to avoid escaping.
- __No unused variables__ - This one catches tons of bugs!
- __Semicolons__ - By default. But there may be a config to support no semicolons.
- __Space after keyword__ - `if (condition) {}`
- __Space after function name__ - `function name (arg) { ... }`
- __No space in array bracket__ - `const arr = [1, 2, 3]`
- __Always space in block__ - `const obj = { foo: 'bar' }`
- __Always `===` instead of `==`__
- __Always handle the node.js err function parameter__
